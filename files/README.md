# PDFs and documents

Add report or paper PDFs here. They will be served at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/files/`.

- **`MMRAG.pdf`** — Industrial Multimodal RAG report (linked from that project).
- **`food-image.pdf`** — Food-Image-Classification report (linked from that project).
- **`Shervan_Shahparnia_Resume.pdf`** — Resume (linked from the hero icons).

You can add more PDFs and link them in `index.html` using the same pattern:
```html
<li><a href="files/your-paper.pdf" class="fa-solid fa-file-pdf" aria-label="Paper PDF"></a></li>
```
